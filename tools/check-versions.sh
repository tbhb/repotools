# check-versions — assert every published version literal names the
# latest release tag.
#
# Eleven sites carry the version: the root APM manifest, the four
# sub-package APM manifests under packages/agents/, the Python package,
# the pre-commit hook manifest's usage comment, three install pins in
# the README (the bare repo ref, the sub-package refs, and the
# pre-commit rev its own code block shows), and the uv lockfile's entry
# for the editable Python package. cog.toml's pre_bump_hooks rewrite
# all eleven during a bump, from the version cog is about to tag; one
# hook covers both README ref pins, since its pattern already matches
# a bare or sub-package ref alike. This is the witness that they did.
#
# Hooks alone would have none. Before they existed, five of the six took
# a hand edit, no gate read them, and every one had fallen behind — the
# README's install pins named releases older than the payload the same
# README describes. A hook added for a seventh site and then quietly
# broken would reproduce that silently, so the gate lists the sites
# independently of cog.toml rather than deriving them from it.
#
# uv.lock is the exception worth knowing about. `uv lock --check` already
# fails the moment it disagrees with the Python package's version, so
# that site breaks a build rather than going stale quietly. It is here
# because the same bump has to move both, not because nothing else
# watched it.
#
# Between releases the literals correctly name the last released version
# rather than HEAD, so this holds at every commit and not only at release
# time. That is why it belongs in the lint aggregate.
#
# Adding another site means a line here and a hook in cog.toml, in that
# order: add the check first and watch it go red.
#
# Findings print one per line in the shape the vale agent template uses,
# and silence means a clean run.
#
# Usage: check-versions.sh [X.Y.Z]
#   With no argument the expected version is the latest tag, which is
#   what the lint aggregate runs. An explicit version is for a caller
#   holding a tag of its own, such as the release postflight.
