# skill-tokens — measure what a skill costs in context, and record it
# beside the skill.
#
# The two halves of a skill are paid for differently. A frontmatter
# description sits in context for every turn of every session, whether
# or not anyone invokes the skill, so its cost is constant and shared.
# The body loads only on invocation, and a bundled script costs nothing
# until something reads it. Measuring them together hides that split,
# so this reports each separately.
#
# Counts come from the real tokenizer through the ant CLI rather than
# from a characters-per-token guess. Claude Opus 4.7 and later use a
# tokenizer that yields roughly 30 percent more tokens than earlier
# models for the same text, which puts any remembered estimate well out
# of date.
#
# Each request carries a fixed envelope of its own. A baseline call
# measures it once, and every figure below has it subtracted, so what
# lands in the JSON is the text alone.
#
# The body budget is the platform's own guidance: keep the SKILL.md body
# under 5k tokens and push reference material into bundled files, which
# cost nothing until something reads them. Exceeding it is a warning
# rather than a refusal, because the number is a recommendation and no
# upload rejects a body for being long. The hard limits on name and
# description live in tools/skill-limits.sh, which stays offline.
#
# Usage: skill-tokens.sh [skill-dir ...]
#        (default: packages/agents/*/.apm/skills/*/)
# Env:   MODEL to count against another model.
#        BODY_BUDGET to move the warning threshold.
