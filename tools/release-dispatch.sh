# release-dispatch — dispatch the release workflow.
#
# This dispatches. It does not release. release.yml SSH-signs the tag
# with a repository secret, under the tagger identity GitHub verifies
# that key against, so no local command can reproduce what it produces.
# Anything here that bumped and tagged locally would mint an unsigned or
# wrongly attributed tag and diverge from the path every consumer pins
# against. There is no bump-version task for the same reason: cocogitto
# owns bumping, it runs inside CI, and a second local bumper would be a
# second source for one number.
#
# Deliberately thin, and deliberately kept that way. The target for
# release management here is a continuously updated release pull request
# whose merge tags and publishes, and under that model releasing is
# merging rather than dispatching, so this is the piece that gets
# superseded. Readiness and verification survive it. No retry, no
# polling, no state.
#
# Usage: release-dispatch.sh [X.Y.Z]
#   With no argument the workflow runs `cog bump --auto`, which derives
#   the version from the Conventional Commit types since the last tag.
#   Readiness prints that derived version, so read it before choosing.

# Named rather than left to the default, and readiness reads the same

# branch, which is right today by coincidence of configuration rather
# than by statement, and `on: workflow_dispatch` constrains nothing:
# it takes no branch filter, so any ref carrying the workflow file can
# run it. release.yml's checkout takes the dispatched ref while its push
# step names main outright, so a dispatch against anything else would
# bump that ref's tree and push the result onto main. Saying the branch
# here costs one flag and makes the target the same statement readiness
# verified.
