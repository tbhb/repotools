# skill-limits — check every skill against the limits the platform
# actually enforces.
#
# Two of these are hard limits. A skill whose name or description
# exceeds them is rejected at upload rather than degraded, and the
# failure surfaces far from the edit that caused it, so catching them
# here costs nothing and saves a confusing round trip:
#
#   name         64 characters, lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
#                only, no XML tags, and neither reserved word
#   description  non-empty, 1024 characters, no XML tags
#
# The body budget is a recommendation rather than a limit, and it is
# measured in tokens, so tools/skill-tokens.sh carries that check where
# the real counts already are. This script stays offline so `mise run lint`
# needs no network.
#
# Findings print one per line in the shape the vale template uses.
# Silence means a clean run.
