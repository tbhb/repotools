# check-script-hygiene — refuse a script whose output an operator's
# configuration could reshape.
#
# The agent reads what these scripts print. A user's ~/.gitconfig,
# ~/.config/gh/config.yml, and locale can all change that output without
# changing the script, and the failures are silent: log.showSignature
# turns a --oneline listing into two lines per commit, so a head -n cap
# shows half a branch as though it were all of it. A collation mismatch
# drops a line from a set comparison. GH_REPO points gh at a different
# repository entirely.
#
# The scripts carry a hardening block for this. That block is a
# convention, and a convention holds only while somebody remembers it,
# so this turns it into a gate. A new script that parses git output and
# skips the wrapper fails the lint run rather than shipping.
#
# Findings print one per line, in the shape the vale template uses.
# Silence means a clean run.
#
# A script with a genuine reason to opt out says so on its own line:
#
#   # hygiene-exempt: <reason>
#
# hygiene-exempt: the rules below quote the command names they look for,
# so this script matches its own patterns. It never invokes gh, and its
# one git call is pinned inline.
#
# Usage: check-script-hygiene.sh [file ...]
