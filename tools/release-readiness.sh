# release-readiness — say whether this repository is ready to release,
# and report the version the automatic path would derive.
#
# Run it before dispatching. Every check here reads and none writes: it
# does not clean the tree, move a pin, or rewrite a literal. A primitive
# that mutates on the way to reporting cannot be run to ask a question,
# and cannot be composed by anything that has not already decided to act.
#
# That rule is why `mise run check-all` is absent. Composing it looks
# obvious, and it would have made this script a writer: check-all reaches
# `tidy`, which is `go mod tidy`, so a passing run could leave go.mod and
# go.sum rewritten. The comprehensive gate arrives instead through the
# checks-green probe below, which asks GitHub what those same gates
# concluded about this exact commit. That answer is the better one
# anyway, since it came from a clean runner on every platform in the
# matrix rather than from whatever this machine happens to hold. Run
# `mise run check-all` by hand where a local sweep is what you want.
#
# The derived version is the part worth reading even on a green run.
# Cog computes a bump from Conventional Commit types, so a run of fixes
# and chores yields a patch where a minor was intended. #25 exists
# because that difference went unnoticed until after the tag. Printing
# it here is the cheapest place to catch it, and it stays informational:
# nothing in this repository knows which version the operator wants.
#
# Checks run cheapest first, so a verdict a dirty tree already settled
# costs no network call to reach.
#
# Findings print one per line and the exit code carries the verdict, so
# a wrapper can branch on it and CI can run it unattended.

# bumps that. So every check in this script asks one question: whether
# the operator's picture of the release is accurate. A local branch name
# says nothing about that, and only one checkout in a repository can
# hold main, so an earlier check asserting the name failed by
# construction in every agent worktree this repository is worked in.
# HEAD standing at the commit origin's release branch points at settles
# the question instead, under any branch name and detached alike.
#
# ls-remote rather than a fetch. Reading the remote answers the question
# without writing a remote-tracking ref, which keeps this task read-only
# in the sense that matters: run it twice and the repository is the same
# either way.

# Separating the failed call from the empty answer matters more than it

# belongs, and the commonest cause of that call failing is the ordinary
# one of asking about a commit nobody has pushed.

# bare nothing. The clean-tree check above already covers the usual
