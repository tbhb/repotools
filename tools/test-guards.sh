# test-guards — regression tests for the fix-prose hook scripts.
#
# The retrospective that produced this skill counted five guard blocks
# in one session and found four of them wrong. A guard that refuses
# legitimate work costs more than the shortcut it prevents, and nothing
# catches that drift once the script stops being new. These cases turn
# each behavior into something a later edit has to keep.
#
# Every case runs against a scratch git repository built here, never
# against the working tree. The checks compare file hashes and walk
# .vale/, so exercising them in place would mean mutating this
# repository's own linter configuration to see them fire, and a failed
# run would leave that mutation behind. A throwaway repository also
# gives the gitignored-style case somewhere honest to live.
#
# Out of `mise run lint` on purpose. It writes to a temporary directory,
# spawns git, and takes long enough to notice, so it belongs with the
# out-of-band recipes rather than in the gate every commit runs.
