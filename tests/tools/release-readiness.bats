# Tests for tools/release-readiness.sh, covering the one check that says
# whether the tree in front of the operator is the tree being released.
#
# That check compares HEAD against the commit origin's release branch
# points at, and the cases worth holding are the ones a branch-name test
# got wrong: an agent worktree, which can never hold main checked out,
# and a detached HEAD. Both are correct releases and both used to be
# refused. The failing arms matter too, because dropping the name test
# is only safe if the commit test still refuses everything it should.
#
# Each test builds a throwaway repository with a bare origin beside it,
# since the script reads the remote with ls-remote. The three programs it
# shells out to are stubbed on PATH: gh, because the check-runs API has
# no answer for a commit nobody pushed anywhere real; mise and cog,
# because neither has anything to say about a synthetic history. What
# they report is held constant so the commit comparison is the only
# thing any assertion here turns on.
#
# The mise stub prints a changelog entry rather than arbitrary text. The
# preview check counts the lines an entry starts, so a stub printing
# anything else fails that check in every test here, including the ones
# asserting a pass.
