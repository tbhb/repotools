# Tests for the `check-preset-refs.mjs` script inlined in
# .github/workflows/renovate-config-validator.yaml, which verifies that
# every `github>` preset reference in a Renovate config resolves.
#
# The script is inlined in the workflow rather than committed as a file
# because `workflow_call` runs against the *caller's* checkout, where a
# file living in this repository would not exist. That constraint holds,
# so these tests extract the heredoc body from the workflow and run the
# shipped bytes rather than a copy. Extracting is also what keeps the
# suite honest: a test against a second copy would pass while the
# workflow shipped anything at all.
#
# The suite lives under tests/workflows/ rather than a literal mirror of
# .github/workflows/, because `bats --recursive tests` never descends
# into a dot directory.
#
# Two stubs stand in for what the script reaches for. `json5` resolves
# out of the Renovate image, which no development box has, so a stub on
# NODE_PATH answers the same require -- fixtures here are therefore
# strict JSON, which is valid JSON5 either way. And GITHUB_API_URL points
# at a local server rather than github.com, so the assertions cover which
# request the script makes rather than what some repository happens to
# hold today.
#
# The case the suite exists for is "a pinned reference is checked at that
# ref". Its control is a preset present on the default branch and absent
# at the pinned ref: without that case a passing test cannot tell the fix
# from the bug it replaced, since both report `ok` for a path that exists
# on main.
