# guard-resolve — PreToolUse gate on Bash, scoped to the conflict
# resolution skill.
#
# The skill body already states these rules. This hook is what makes
# them hold: instructions degrade under a long context, an exit-2 deny
# does not.
#
# Three rules:
#
#   1. `--ours` and `--theirs` are refused, on checkout and restore
#      alike. During a rebase they mean the opposite of what the words
#      suggest, and getting them backwards resolves the file to the
#      wrong content with no error and no symptom until much later.
#      take-side.sh takes the same decision under names that survive
#      being read quickly.
#   2. Staging a path that still carries conflict markers is refused.
#      git will stage it, `git rebase --continue` will commit it, and
#      the markers surface days later inside a file nobody was looking
#      at.
#   3. Whole-tree staging is refused. A conflict resolution stages the
#      paths it resolved; a wildcard sweeps in whatever else the
#      worktree is carrying, and during a rebase that includes files an
#      earlier commit in the replay left behind.
#
# Exit 2 blocks and hands stderr back as the reason. Exit 0 defers to
# the normal permission flow.

A wrong pick here resolves cleanly and stays wrong.

Name the side instead:

  bash .claude/skills/resolve-rebase-conflicts/scripts/take-side.sh <path> replayed-side
