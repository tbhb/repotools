# take-side — resolve a conflict by taking one whole side, named the way
# a person thinks about it.
#
# `git checkout --ours` during a rebase takes the branch being replayed
# onto, and `--theirs` takes the commit being replayed. That is inverted
# from what the words suggest to anyone who has not just read the
# manual, because a rebase checks out the upstream and replays your work
# onto it, so your work is the side arriving. The mistake it produces is
# silent: the file resolves, the rebase continues, and a commit lands
# carrying the opposite of what was meant.
#
# This takes `base-side` and `replayed-side` instead, prints which
# commit each one is before acting, and translates to the stage number
# rather than the flag. Stage 2 is the base side and stage 3 is the
# replayed side, which is the one mapping in this area that never moves.
#
# Taking a whole side is right for a generated file, where merging two
# versions of machine output means nothing, and for a delete/modify
# where the decision is which intent wins. It is wrong wherever both
# sides carry work that has to survive, and this script cannot tell the
# difference. That judgement is the caller's.
#
# Usage: take-side.sh <path> <base-side|replayed-side>
# Exit:  0 resolved and staged, 1 refused.
