# arm-guard — PostToolUse on Skill, recording which file fix-prose was
# given, so guard-target.sh knows what to refuse.
#
# The guard has to name one path, and only the invocation knows it. The
# Skill payload carries the arguments verbatim, so the first word of
# them is the target, resolved against the payload's own cwd rather than
# against wherever this process happens to start.
#
# Verified against Claude Code 2.1.220 with a throwaway project: a
# PostToolUse hook declared in a skill's own frontmatter DOES fire for
# that skill's own invocation, and the payload carries tool_input.skill
# plus tool_input.args. The published reference describes a
# tool_input.skill_name instead, which this version never sends.
#
# That probe also settled why fix-prose is not a `context: fork` skill.
# A forked skill's frontmatter hooks register nowhere: the caller's
# session never sees them, which is why the pull request guard is
# declared by `pr` rather than by write-pr-description. A plain skill's
# hooks do register, they fire for the caller's own tool calls, and they
# stay silent for an Agent-tool subagent's. That is exactly the scoping
# a guard here needs, so the skill body spawns the fixer through the
# Agent tool and leaves its own frontmatter plain.
#
# The lock lives under the git directory, which is per-worktree, and it
# holds a single slot that each invocation overwrites. It protects one
# path for as long as that path holds a document: guard-target.sh
# releases the lock on the first edit it sees after the file is gone.
# A session running several commits writes a new COMMIT_AGENTMSG for each
# one, and without that release the first commit's lock refused the
# second commit's draft.
#
# Never blocks. A PostToolUse hook that fails would only obstruct the
# invocation it exists to protect.
