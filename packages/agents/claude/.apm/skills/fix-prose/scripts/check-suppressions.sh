# check-suppressions — refuse to let a lint finding be cleared by
# changing the rules instead of the prose.
#
# A rule that can't be met is a genuine outcome here, and the fixer is
# told to report one rather than invent text. What must never happen
# instead is clearing the finding by changing the rules: an edit
# to .vale.ini, a word appended to the project vocabulary, an inline
# `vale off` comment, a rewritten style file. Every one of those
# produces a clean lint run over a document nobody actually fixed.
#
# Instructions alone don't prevent it. The fixer runs unguarded inside
# its own fork, because the PreToolUse guard in this skill's frontmatter
# fires for the caller's session and stays silent for a subagent's, so
# nothing in the harness stops it from editing a style file. This script
# is the mechanical answer, and it deliberately runs on the caller's
# side: an agent that certifies its own work certifies nothing.
#
# Two modes, one definition of the guarded set, so the two halves stay
# consistent:
#
#   --baseline <target>   record the state before the fixer runs.
#                         arm-guard.sh calls this from the PostToolUse
#                         hook, which fires at exactly that moment.
#   --verify              compare against the baseline afterwards.
#   --diff                print what the fixer changed, for the reviewer.
#
# The synced vale style packages are why the configuration half hashes
# files directly rather than asking git. .gitignore excludes .vale/* apart
# from the project styles, so an edit to .vale/ai-tells/VerbTricolon.yml
# never shows up in git status. This repository already knows that rule
# misfires, which makes it the first file an agent would edit when no
# wording change clears the finding.
#
# Findings print one per line in the shape the vale template uses.
# Silence means a clean run, and the exit code carries the result.
#
# A missing baseline is a finding rather than a pass. A check that
# reports zero has more likely failed to run than found nothing.
