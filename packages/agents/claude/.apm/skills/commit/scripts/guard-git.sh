# guard-git — PreToolUse gate on Bash, scoped to the commit skill.
#
# The skill body already states these rules. This hook is what makes them
# hold: instructions degrade under a long context, an exit-2 deny does
# not. Declaring it in the skill's frontmatter rather than in
# settings.json keeps it out of a session that never asked for it, and
# the workflow scope below keeps it out of the rest of a session that
# did.
#
# Two rules, in order of how they fire:
#
#   1. Whole-tree staging (`git add -A`, `git add .`) is refused. An
#      atomic commit names its paths; a wildcard sweeps in whatever else
#      the worktree happens to be carrying.
#   2. A direct `git commit` is refused whatever flags it carries. The
#      workflow commits through scripts/commit.sh, and an inline -m or
#      a --no-verify is refused with its own reason before the general
#      one, because those two are wrong for reasons of their own.
#
# The review-signature check used to sit here and now sits in that
# script. A PreToolUse hook reads the Bash tool call, and the
# `git commit` inside a script is not one, so a gate placed here would
# go unread on the path the workflow actually takes. The script is also
# the only place that can compare the finished commit against what was
# staged for it, which a hook running before the commit cannot do.
#
# One entry point is what makes that split hold. Leaving a second,
# hook-gated way to commit would mean keeping both copies of the
# signature check in step with each other forever.
#
# Exit 2 blocks and hands stderr back as the reason. Exit 0 defers to the
# normal permission flow. Verified against Claude Code 2.1.220: a
# skill-frontmatter PreToolUse hook receives the Bash payload with the
# command at .tool_input.command, and exit 2 does block the call.

# cover variables that silently retarget a command: GH_REPO sends gh at
# another repository, CDPATH makes a relative cd print somewhere else.

# --- workflow scope ---------------------------------------------------
# A skill's frontmatter hooks outlive the turn that invoked the skill.
# Without a scope of its own this guard would go on policing every later
# `git add` and `git commit` in the session, and it did: a legitimate
# `git commit --amend` during unrelated release work was refused long
# after the commit workflow it belonged to had ended.
#
# preflight.sh arms the guard by recording the commit HEAD sat at when
# the workflow opened. A commit workflow leaves HEAD alone until it
# commits, so the mark matches for as long as the workflow is open, and
# the commit that ends the workflow moves HEAD past the mark and stands
# the guard down. Nothing has to remember to clear anything, which is
# the point: an end-of-workflow cleanup step is exactly the kind of
# thing an abandoned run skips.
#
# The mark is read from the repository holding the session rather than
# from wherever the command retargets, because the workflow is anchored
# where the skill ran. Outside a repository there is no workflow to
# scope, so the guard stands aside.

# Heredoc bodies are data, not commands. A script written through a

# at what the shell will actually run.

# so both spellings are recognized and the closing line is matched after
# trimming its leading whitespace.
