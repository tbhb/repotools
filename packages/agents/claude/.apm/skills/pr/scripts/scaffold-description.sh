# scaffold-description — build PR_AGENTDESC.md from the repository's
# pull request template.
#
# The template is a body and nothing else, because that is all GitHub
# puts in the web form. The draft needs two things wrapped around it:
# YAML frontmatter carrying the pull request properties, and a level 1
# heading carrying the title. So this cannot be a copy.
#
# Doing it here rather than in an instruction means the sections always
# match the template as it stands today. An agent transcribing them by
# hand gets one wrong eventually, and the mismatch surfaces as a
# validator finding rather than as the transcription slip it was.
#
# The instructional comments carry through on purpose. They tell the
# writer what each section is asking for, and validate-description.sh
# refuses any that survive into a finished draft, so they cannot be
# mistaken for content.
#
# Never clobbers an existing draft. A description under revision is
# worth more than a fresh scaffold, and --force is the only way past.
#
# Usage: scaffold-description.sh [--force] [base-branch]

# another repository, CDPATH makes a relative cd print somewhere else.
