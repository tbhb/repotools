# guard-rebase — PreToolUse gate on Bash, scoped to the rebase skill.
#
# The skill body already states these rules. This hook is what makes
# them hold: instructions degrade under a long context, an exit-2 deny
# does not. It stays scoped to the skill's frontmatter rather than to
# settings.json so it governs a rebase workflow and nothing else.
#
# Five rules, in order of how they fire:
#
#   1. A bare `git stash pop` or `git stash apply` is refused. Worktrees
#      share one global stash stack, and its indices shift whenever any
#      worktree pushes, so a bare pop takes whatever sits at stash@{0}
#      at that instant, which may belong to another session.
#   2. Starting a rebase by hand is refused unless it pins the two
#      settings itself. Both are operator preferences that can be on
#      without anyone here knowing, which is what the script exists to
#      settle. A caller spelling them out has settled it already, so
#      the rule reads the command rather than insisting on the script.
#   3. `git rebase --continue` is refused. git checks that no path is
#      unmerged and checks nothing else; a file staged with conflict
#      markers still in it continues happily into a commit.
#   4. `git rebase --skip` is refused. Skipping is right only where the
#      commit is already empty, and the script proves that before it
#      skips rather than taking anyone's word.
#   5. A bare `git push --force` is refused. A rebase rewrites the
#      branch, so a force push is the move that follows it, and the
#      lease is what keeps that from discarding someone else's work.
#
# `git rebase --abort` stays open. Abandoning is always safe, and the
# moment someone wants it is the wrong moment to make them read a
# refusal.
#
# Exit 2 blocks and hands stderr back as the reason. Exit 0 defers to
# the normal permission flow.

preferences that can be on without this session knowing. updateRefs moves
other local branches pointing into the replayed range; autoSquash collapses
a fixup! commit that earned its own review. It also records the pre-rebase
tip, which is what verify-rebase.sh compares the result against.

Spelling both settings out passes too, which is the form the commit skill
uses at the end of its own run:

  git -c rebase.updateRefs=false -c rebase.autoSquash=false rebase --autostash <base>

So does the sweep that runs a gate at every commit:

  git -c rebase.updateRefs=false rebase --exec 'mise run lint' <base>"
