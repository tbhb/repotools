# The rebase SKILL.md inlines this through the !`...` preprocessor, so it

# going to stop on.

# Output is plain text under `== section ==` headers, each self-contained
# so a partially-read report still answers something. Nothing here
# mutates the repository or the index. The one network call fetches the
# base branch; REBASE_PREFLIGHT_FETCH=0 skips it.
