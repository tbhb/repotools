# rebase-status — say where a stopped rebase actually is.
#
# `git status` during a rebase answers a different question than the one
# the workflow has. It says which files are unmerged; it does not say
# which commit stopped, how far through the replay that commit sits,
# what git staged without asking, or whether a resolution someone
# already made left conflict markers behind.
#
# Read-only. Nothing here stages, resolves, or advances anything.
#
# Usage: rebase-status.sh
# Exit:  0 stopped with conflicts to resolve, 1 no rebase in progress,
#        2 stopped for a reason other than a conflict.
