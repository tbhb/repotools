# marker-scan — find conflict markers in a set of paths, and know which
# markers are a file's subject rather than its damage.
#
# Three callers need this answer and they must not disagree about it.
# rebase-status.sh reports markers at a stop, continue-rebase.sh refuses
# to advance past staged ones, and verify-rebase.sh sweeps the finished
# tree. A rule that lived in three copies would drift, and the drift
# that matters is the one where the reporting is stricter than the
# refusal, so a file gets flagged and then committed anyway.
#
# What counts as a marker: only the three directional lines. A bare
# ======= opens no conflict and closes none, and it is an ordinary
# Markdown setext heading underline, so matching it flags every document
# in a repository like this one.
#
# What does not count: a file whose subject is conflict markers. The
# resolve-rebase-conflicts skill documents the marker shape by showing
# it, and that document ships into every repository the package installs
# into, so the exemption is built in rather than left to each consumer
# to discover after the first false alarm. Anything else declares itself
# through a git attribute:
#
#   docs/merge-guide.md conflict-markers=documented
#
# Usage: marker-scan.sh [--staged] <path> [path ...]
#        --staged reads the index blob rather than the worktree file,
#        which is what a commit is about to carry.
# Exit:  0 nothing found, 1 markers found, 2 usage error.
