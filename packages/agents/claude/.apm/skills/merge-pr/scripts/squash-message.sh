# squash-message — brief whoever writes the squash commit message, then
# leave them a skeleton to write into.
#
# A squash message is not a reformatted pull request description. It is
# the one commit a whole branch leaves behind, and it answers to someone
# running git log years from now who has neither the description nor the
# review thread beside them. Writing it means reading everything that
# landed and deciding what still matters. That is a writing exercise,
# not a transformation, and no script performs it. This one does not
# try.
#
# What a script can do is put every input in front of the writer at
# once: the description as published, every commit message the squash
# collapses, the diffstat, and the trailers those commits carry. Then it
# writes the parts that are mechanical rather than editorial — the
# subject, whose reference has to name this pull request, and the
# footer, whose closing keywords and trailers come from elsewhere — and
# leaves the body empty for the writer.
#
# Nothing caps the commit listing. A cap is what turns a briefing into a
# misleading sample: the reader cannot tell a branch of eight commits
# from the first eight of forty, and the whole question here is what one
# message owes to everything that actually landed.
#
# Every fact comes from gh rather than from the local repository. This
# skill also merges pull requests nobody here authored, a dependency
# bump being the usual case, and those branches are often not checked
# out at all.
#
# Usage: squash-message.sh [pull-request-number]
# Written to bash 3.2.

#
# The walk crosses blank lines on purpose, which git's own trailer
# parser does not. Commits in these repositories routinely separate
# Assisted-by from Signed-off-by with one, and a walk that stopped there
# would drop the attribution on every squash. The cost is that a body
# whose last line happens to read `Word: something` can be swept in, and
# that lands visibly in the footer where the writer sees it.
#
# Stopping short of line 1 covers a commit with no body: its subject
# reads as `type: description`, which is trailer-shaped, and every
# one-line commit would otherwise contribute its own subject.

--- what is missing

The body. Everything above it is mechanical and everything in it is
not, so the skeleton stops where the writing starts.

Write the body between the subject and the footer. It accounts for the
whole stack of commits above in plain prose: the problem the branch
solves, the constraint that shaped the approach, what breaks without
it. Summary and Why from the description are the raw material. Discard
Verification, which reported what a reviewer needed at the time. Keep
Risk only where it names a rollback the reader would not guess.

Nothing merges until review-squash-message clears the result, and an
empty body fails that review by definition.
NOTE
