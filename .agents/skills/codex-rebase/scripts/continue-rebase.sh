# continue-rebase — advance a stopped rebase, after checking the two
# things git will not check for you.
#
# git refuses to continue while a path is unmerged, and that is the only
# refusal it makes. Stage a file with `<<<<<<<` still in it and the
# rebase continues happily, writing the markers into a commit that then
# has to be found and unpicked later. This script reads the staged
# content first, so that commit never gets made.
#
# The second check is on `--skip`. Skipping is right for exactly one
# situation: the replayed commit's change is already present, so
# applying it produces nothing. It is wrong for every other situation,
# where it discards a commit's work silently. `--skip-empty` proves the
# emptiness before it skips, rather than taking the caller's word.
#
# Usage: continue-rebase.sh [--skip-empty]
# Exit:  0 the rebase finished, 1 it stopped again, 2 it cannot advance
#        yet and the reason is printed.
