# release-clone — run the release tasks against a throwaway clone of
# the release branch, from whatever checkout invoked them.
#
# The release is a statement about origin/main and nothing else. The
# workflow checks that branch out fresh on the runner, so the tree a
# local checkout happens to hold has never been the thing being
# released. Reading the version literals, the changelog preview, and
# the derived version out of a clone of origin/main therefore answers
# the question more accurately than reading them out of a working
# checkout, which may sit on another branch or trail the remote.
#
# It also frees the release from the checkout it runs in. Several agent
# worktrees run here at once and the local main checkout stays pristine,
# so requiring the operator to move a checkout onto the release commit
# was a demand this repository's own layout could not meet.
#
# The clone costs almost nothing. `--reference` points it at the local
# object store, so it makes hard links to what is already on disk and
# fetches only what the remote has that the local repository does not.
#
# What the clone gives up, and what replaces it. Inside a fresh clone
# "the working tree is clean" and "HEAD is the release commit" are true
# by construction, so readiness stops reporting them as findings. Those
# two checks existed to catch one thing: an operator releasing while
# believing uncommitted or unmerged work was in it. `prepare` prints
# that as an advisory read from the invoking checkout instead. It says
# what the release leaves behind rather than refusing, because a branch
# in flight is the normal state here and never a reason a release of
# main cannot proceed.
#
# Nothing outside the clone changes. It borrows objects from the local
# repository and writes none back, reads the invoking checkout for the
# advisory and writes nothing there beyond a pointer file inside its git
# directory, and grants mise its trust through the environment rather
# than through the operator's global trust store.
#
# The clone is never a place to make a release. Nothing here tags,
# bumps, or commits, in the clone or anywhere else. The tag is
# SSH-signed inside release.yml under a key this machine does not hold.
#
# Usage: release-clone.sh prepare
#        release-clone.sh refresh
#        release-clone.sh path
#        release-clone.sh run <mise-task> [args...]
#        release-clone.sh done
