#
# Two invariants, and both fail quietly rather than loudly.
#
# The tag is SSH-signed inside release.yml, with a repository secret,
# under the tagger identity GitHub verifies that key against. Nothing on
# a development box reproduces any of that. A local `git tag` therefore
# mints an object that looks like a release and carries no signature,
# and `push --follow-tags` will happily send it. Refusing the tagging
# and bumping forms outright is the only reliable answer, because the
# bad tag is indistinguishable from the good one until somebody reads
# the object.
#
# A bare `gh workflow run release.yml` is the second. It reaches the
# same workflow as the task, and skips the readiness preflight and the
# version confirmation on the way -- the confirmation being the one
# thing this skill does that a task cannot. #25 exists because the
# derived version differed from the intended one and nobody looked.
#
# Reading stays open throughout. Listing tags, viewing runs, and
# inspecting a tag object all run without asking, because none of them
# can produce a release.
#
# Exit 2 blocks and hands stderr back as the reason. Verified against
# Claude Code 2.1.220: a skill-frontmatter PreToolUse hook receives the
# Bash payload with the command at .tool_input.command, and exit 2 does
# block the call.
