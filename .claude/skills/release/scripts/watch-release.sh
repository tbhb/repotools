# watch-release — emit one line per release step as it settles, then
# exit.
#
# `gh workflow run` returns the moment GitHub accepts the request, long
# before anything is tagged, so a dispatch on its own leaves the release
# in an unknown state. This closes that gap.
#
# Written as an event stream for the Monitor tool, on the same contract
# watch-checks.sh follows:
#
#   * one line per event, flushed as it happens
#   * every terminal state emits, not only the passing one, because a
#     watcher that prints nothing on failure is indistinguishable from a
#     watcher that is still waiting
#   * the command exits once the run stops moving, so the watch ends by
#     itself rather than sitting armed until the timeout
#
# It also works as a plain blocking call, where the exit code carries
# the outcome: 0 the run succeeded, 1 it did not, 2 the wait ran out or
# the run never appeared.
#
# The baseline argument is what makes the run unambiguous. Between the
# dispatch and the run registering, the newest release run is still the
# previous release's, and reading that one would report a success that
# belongs to a tag cut weeks ago. Take the newest run id before
# dispatching, pass it here, and this waits for a different one:
#
#   gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId \
#     --jq '.[0].databaseId'
#
# Pass `none` where the repository has never run the workflow.
#
# Read-only. It dispatches nothing and never retries a dispatch: a run
# it cannot identify is reported and left alone, because a second
# release is far worse than a stalled one.
#
# Usage: watch-release.sh <baseline-run-id|none>
# Written to bash 3.2.
