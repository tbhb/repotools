# context — gather what judging a release version needs, in one call.
#
# The reviewer opens holding its material rather than going to look for
# it. That shape came out of measuring the earlier reviewers here: the
# one left to run its own commands spent most of its calls repeating a
# fetch it had already made.
#
# Everything is read out of the release clone rather than out of the
# checkout that invoked the release. The version under discussion is the
# one that would be cut from the release branch, so a commit range taken
# from a local branch would be a range nobody is releasing.
#
# The consumer surface is the part worth explaining. Cog derives a bump
# from Conventional Commit types alone, which is exactly right for a
# change whose type describes its blast radius and exactly wrong for one
# whose type describes its author's intent. A `build:` commit that
# rewrites the vendored task payload reaches every consumer on the next
# sync. Listing which changed paths are published gives the reviewer the
# evidence for that call, since nothing in the commit type carries it.
#
# Read-only, and it prints rather than deciding. The judgement belongs to
# the reviewer reading this.
#
# Usage: context.sh [clone-path]
#   Without an argument it asks release-clone.sh where the clone is.
